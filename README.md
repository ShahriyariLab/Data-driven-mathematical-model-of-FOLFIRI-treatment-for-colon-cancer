# Data-driven-mathematical-model-of-FOLFIRI-treatment-for-colon-cancer

Many colon cancer patients show resistance to their treatments. Therefore, it is important to consider unique characteristic of each tumor to find the best treatment options for each patient. In this study, we develop a data driven mathematical model for interaction between the tumor microenvironment and FOLFIRI drug agents in colon cancer.

This repository contains the following scripts:
